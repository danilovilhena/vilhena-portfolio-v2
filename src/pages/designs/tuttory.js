            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>This project was motivated by a class in my Computer Science course. The goal was to deliver a product using in a 4 week sprint.</p>
            <p>That way, we decided to build an application to facilitate the connection between private teachers and students and I was responsible for the design part of the team.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As we only had one sprint, the Tuttory app would consist of an onboarding process, login/registration and a look at the features (decided beforehand) both as a teacher and as a student, since the app would be used by both.</p>
            <p>I initially made a wireframe of the project screens, to get an overview of the elements and be able to structure them on the screens.</p>
            <p>After that, we decided on the colors of the product and I started writing the interface texts. Then, I applied both to the wireframes and presented the project to the team for validation.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>As this is a mobile project, I have put only three demo screens on this page. To see the other screens, go to the Figma link below the image.</p>
