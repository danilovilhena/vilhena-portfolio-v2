            <p className="project-date"><span aria-label="Calendar" role="img">ðŸ“…</span> April 2021</p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Since they put this site online, I started using it because I follow the podcast a lot. However, since the beginning there were already noticeable design flaws and inconsistencies in the interface that were only increasing.</p>
            <p>Many components ready and characteristic of frameworks (Material, Bootstrap, etc) were scattered throughout the site without following any pattern.</p>
            <p>So, I decided to do this redesign to bring this consistency, solve other problems I identified on the site both to practice UI design and to propose this change to the site developers.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Initially, I analyzed the pages to identify the interface flaws, such as: hierarchy between elements, contrast, layout, design and accessibility in general.</p>
            <p>After this analysis, I took screenshots of all the screens and started working on Figma. Taking the points I had listed in the analysis, I started making the new components and then structuring them on the page.</p>
            <p>One of the most common errors in the old site was the inconsistency between elements. Several of them that had the same function did not follow the same style (sometimes they differed greatly).</p>
            <p>Another very present point was the lack of hierarchy between the components. Headings, subheadings, and paragraphs had almost no distinction, making sections of the site difficult to understand.</p>
