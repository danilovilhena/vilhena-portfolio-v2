            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>For this project, the goal was to build my minimalist yet aesthetically pleasing version of a to-do list (one of the most common applications in development courses) to practice a little UI design.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>As this was a minimalist design, I wanted to put only the fundamental elements to build a functional to-do list. This required self-explanatory and intuitive elements, such as the text field (with text that prompts the user to act) and the action button (add new task) standing out from the rest of the page.</p>
            <p>As for the tasks, it was necessary that they were clearly divided and that the user can easily interact with them, either by deleting or marking as completed.</p>
            <p>Also, the completed tasks section needed to be distinct from the other tasks but still be present in the interface, so that the user can see their progress.</p>
