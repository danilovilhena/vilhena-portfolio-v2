            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>In this project, the clients asked for a sales page for a course they produced. So the main goals for this project were: to achieve excellent performance, to be fully responsive, and to have good CTAs (calls to action) to achieve higher conversion rates.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Since the focus of this project was performance, I decided to use the Gatsby framework to be able to program in React and generate static pages in production. This allowed me to achieve a lighter and more optimized page.</p>
            <p>In addition, Gatsby has some optimization plugins, such as: minify JS and CSS files, remove unused CSS rules, preload fonts and other links, generate the site routes automatically (according to the folder structure) and assemble the sitemap according to such routes.</p>
            <p>As for the development itself, the project was quite simple with few pages to be developed. Thus, most of the efforts in this project were focused on performance, always checking the page in Google Lighthouse and making the necessary changes to achieve a score of 100, such as: compressing images, uploading only the necessary files and reducing bundle sizes.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the other focus of the project was to make the page responsive for all devices, especially for cell phones, since most of the access comes from these devices. I used Tailwind as a CSS framework and for the breakpoints I took Bootstrap as a reference, but I didn't use the mobile first concept, which could make this styling process easier.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I achieved the goals set at the beginning of development: to achieve a good score on PageSpeed Insights and make the page fully responsive.</p>
